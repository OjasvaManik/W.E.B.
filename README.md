# W.E.B. (Water Efficiency Bank)  

**A Knowledge-Sharing Platform for Water Conservation Techniques**  

---  
**Note**: This project was developed as part of an academic initiative to demonstrate how technology can address environmental challenges.  

---
## Overview  
W.E.B. is a digital platform designed to centralize and democratize access to water-saving knowledge. Combining a structured wiki with community discussion features, it bridges the gap between technical research and on-ground implementation for farmers, policymakers, and conservationists.  

### Key Features  
- **Wiki Knowledge Base**  
  - Standardized templates for submitting water-saving techniques  
  - Automated categorization by usage type (agricultural/industrial/urban) and region  
  - Search and filtering for efficient discovery  

- **Community Forum**  
  - Threaded discussions to refine and adapt techniques  
  - Commenting and voting on articles  
  - Expert moderation for quality control  

- **User Management**  
  - Secure registration and authentication  
  - Customizable profiles and preferences  

## Technical Stack  
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Kotlin)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with Flyway migrations)  

## Objectives  
1. Centralize fragmented water conservation knowledge.  
2. Facilitate peer-to-peer learning through community discussions.  
3. Support localized adaptation of techniques.  

## Future Scope  
- Mobile accessibility for low-bandwidth regions  
- Integration with agricultural extension services  
- Multimedia guides (videos, interactive tools)  

---  
**Contribute**: Submit articles, join discussions, or report issues to help improve water efficiency globally.
